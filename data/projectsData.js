    title: 'Benchmark ',
    description: `Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various quantitative reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, such as MMLU and MATH. 
    However, many of these benchmarks are losing utility as LLMs get increasingly high scores, despite not yet achieving expert level performance in these domains.
    We introduce \name{}, a novel benchmark composed of advanced reasoning problems designed to evaluate LLMs on text comprehension and expert domain reasoning. `,

    title: 'Advanced Reasoning Benchmark (ARB) Project',
    description: `The Advanced Reasoning Benchmark (ARB) Project aims to develop advanced prompting methods and measure the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving academic problems. Our goal is to push the boundaries of what LLMs are capable of and improve their ability to reason and solve complex problems.`,

    title: 'Minerva-OCR Project',
    description: `The Minerva-OCR Project aims to develop an OCR model of quality comparable to proprietary OCR solutions. Our model can generate bounding boxes around any word that appears on an image and label them with the corresponding word, providing a powerful tool for extracting text from images.`,

    title: 'Video-RL: Exploring video pretraining for sample efficient RL',
    description: `The Exploring video pretraining for sample efficient RL project aims to improve the pre-training of video models for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. By developing better pre-training methods, we hope to improve the performance of RL agents and reduce the amount of data required for training.`,
