    title: 'Benchmark ',
    description: `Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various quantitative reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, such as MMLU and MATH. 
    However, many of these benchmarks are losing utility as LLMs get increasingly high scores, despite not yet achieving expert level performance in these domains.
    We introduce \name{}, a novel benchmark composed of advanced reasoning problems designed to evaluate LLMs on text comprehension and expert domain reasoning. `,

    title: 'Multimodal Dataset Project',
    description: `Imagine being able to travel back in time or to the future. Simple turn the knob
    to the desired date and press 'Go'. No more worrying about lost keys or
    forgotten headphones with this simple yet affordable solution.`,

    title: 'Minerva-OCR Project',
    description: `The Minerva-OCR Project aims to develop an OCR model of quality comparable to proprietary OCR solutions. Our model can generate bounding boxes around any word that appears on an image and label them with the corresponding word, providing a powerful tool for extracting text from images.`,

    title: 'Video-RL: Exploring video pretraining for sample efficient RL',
    description: `The Exploring video pretraining for sample efficient RL project aims to improve the pre-training of video models for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. By developing better pre-training methods, we hope to improve the performance of RL agents and reduce the amount of data required for training.`,

    description: `The Non-English GPTs and better datasets and tokenizers project aims to build higher-quality non-English datasets and tokenizers, and finetune non-English GPTs out of a pretrained English GPT. Our goal is to improve the performance of non-English language models and make them more accessible to a wider audience.`,
