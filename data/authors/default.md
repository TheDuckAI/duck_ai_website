We are DuckAI, an open and scalable academic lab and open-source community working on various Machine Learning projects. 
Our team consists of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology and beyond, driven by our passion for investigating large language models and multimodal systems. 


Our present endeavors concentrate on the development and analysis of a variety of dataset projects, with the aim of comprehending the depth and performance of these models across diverse domains. 

Our objective is to welcome people with a variety of backgrounds to cutting-edge ML projects and rapidly scale up our community to make an impact on the ML landscape. 

We are particularly devoted to open-sourcing datasets that can turn into an important infrastructure for the community and exploring various ways to improve the design of foundation models.
